Things that we need to consider

1. check for .rc files for both /etc/blah.rc or current directory blah.rc, if not set base default ENV vars 
2. while loop until they do the exit command 
3. Look for key words 
4. run check if the command is in the PATH and if yes, parse and run the command 
5. Reloop and start the command all over again
